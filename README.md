Well, you are a ancient artifact that used to save world from waves. Every 100 years a hero summoned to use spear and slay all monsters. But now they summon teenager and he even don't know how to fight! Help him to survive and save the world.  
Made in 3 hours for TriJam-63. Completely underestimate my tasks, so quite unfinished game. Wanna to make it roguelike, but for now just first room & basic mechanics.
